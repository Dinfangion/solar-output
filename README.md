solar energy output - photovoltaic system

There are several options to monitor your solar energy output.

These notes describe the SAJ Sununo plus solar inverter.

Solar panels => solar inverter => rs232-to-ethernet module => router => LAN/internet.

1. Use the android app of SAJ, and the login that you received during installation.
   You can read the outputs and graphs which are posted from your solar inverter to a SAJ server in Alibaba Cloud.
2. Scan with nmap/zenmap gui for the MAC-address and IP of your solar inverter.
   Use your browser to go the overview on http://x.x.x.x
3. Make a script to post your energy output to your own database and/or pvoutput.org

**My setup:**

Hardware: Raspberry Pi 3 https://www.raspberrypi.org/  
Operating system: Raspbian 9 stretch https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=raspbian     
Software: Bash 4.4.12, Python 2.7.13, Mariadb-server 10.1.23  
sudo apt-get install mariadb-server python-requests python-pymysql nmap

1. Activate your API-Key on pvoutput.org
2. Create your local database (optional)

```
CREATE DATABASE solar DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
use solar;
create table solar_output (
	time_stamp DATETIME PRIMARY KEY,
	pac1 INT,
	e_today FLOAT
);
```

crontab for root: (yes root, otherwise nmap doesn't output everything you need)
```
*/10 * * * * /home/user/solar/solar-output.py
```
